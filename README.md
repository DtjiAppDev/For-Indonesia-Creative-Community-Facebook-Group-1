# For-Indonesia-Creative-Community-Facebook-Group
This repository contains all the files I created for contributing to "Indonesia Creative Community" Facebook group.

Important information for users:
1. Each folder in this repository represents one application I developed. So, if you go to the folder 'Quadratic Equation Solver'
in this repository, you will see all the files required for that application. Also, in each folder, there will be a file named
"User Guide.pdf" which guides you on how to use the application with the same name as the name of the folder it is placed in.
2. Each folder in this repository has an executable file (e.g. an ".exe" file) used to run the application. Where the application can
be run at depends on the extension of the executable file. If it is an ".exe" file, you can download it and then run it on your
personal computer (PC).
